# battlesnake-node(js)

A simple [BattleSnake AI](http://battlesnake.io) written in Javascript for NodeJS.

To get started you'll need a working NodeJS development environment, and at least read the Heroku docs on [deploying a NodeJS app](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs).

If you haven't setup a NodeJS development environment before, read [how to get started with NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/documentation/tutorials/). You'll also need [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for easy JS dependency management.

This client uses [Express4](http://expressjs.com/) for easy route management, read up on the docs to learn more about reading incoming JSON params, writing responses, etc.
